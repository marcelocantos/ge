# Issues

Tracked as individual markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Managed via Claude Code:

- **`/file-bug <description>`** — create a new issue
- **`/triage`** — review open issues
- To close: set `status: closed` in frontmatter, add a final update, move to `closed/`

## Open

| # | Title | Tags | Created |

## Closed
